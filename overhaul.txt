implement scrolling ability with paused mouse, add to pipe server
add profiles to settings files
make graphical utility that can load separate profiles

Automatic Detection Of Display Configuration:
"EnumDisplayDevicesA" to get device names and device strings
"EnumDisplayMonitors" to get device names of active monitors
do some sort of compare
    if \\.\DISPLAY1 is active in the string is "Intel Graphics P530"
    then I must be using a single monitor?
    or if i find any "CalDigit" strings in the active device string
    then i must be in a dual monitor setup
This all seems too complicated and much work to implement correctly
in addition i don't think this would scale to multiple other users easily
